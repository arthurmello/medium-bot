# Medium bot
This is a tool to automatically follow users on Medium, based on the articles they have clapped for.

## Full description

This project was done for didatic purposes (I wanted to learn how to use Selenium and practice Flask).
It takes as inputs the user's email adress, password, and a subject of interest. It the logs in to www.medium.com, searches for that subject of interest, and follows users that clapped for the top articles within those subjects. It is built within a simple Flask interface that lets you type those inputs in a user-friendly interface.
This is for didatic purposes only, and I suggest you follow Medium's guidelines and policies.
